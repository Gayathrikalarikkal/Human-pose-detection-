# Human-pose-detection-
# ABSTRACT:
Human pose estimation is a deep-rooted problem in computer vision that has exposed many challenges in the past. Analyzing human activities is beneficial in many fields like video surveillance, biometrics, assisted living, at-home health monitoring etc. With our fast-paced lives these days, people usually prefer exercising at home but feel the need of an instructor to evaluate their exercise form. As these resources are not always available, human pose recognition can be used to build a self-instruction exercise system that allows people to learn and practice exercises correctly by themselves.
